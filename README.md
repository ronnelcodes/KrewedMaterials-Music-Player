KrewedMaterials Music Player
This is a music player I created to play a few of my favorite songs from my massive collection.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I put in a simple HTML boilerplate with FontAwesome icons to show  Play, Previous and Next. Then I styled with my favorite color and added animations in CSS. Finally, I added the functionality in JavaScript, which allows users to play, pause or skip a track forward or backward.


## Lessons Learned:

In building this project, I found out about the tool cdnjs.com, which houses 4,013 JaveScript and CSS libraries.
